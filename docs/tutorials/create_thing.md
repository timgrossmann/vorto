# Creating a thing in the Bosch IoT Suite from a Vorto Information Model

This tutorial explains how to create a thing in the Bosch IoT Suite that was described as a Vorto Information Model.

As an example, the [Octopus board](http://vorto.eclipse.org/#/details/com.bosch.iot.suite:OctopusSuiteEdition:1.0.0) based on ESP 8266 is used. 


## Prerequisites]

* [Postman installed](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
